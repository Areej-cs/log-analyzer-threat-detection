# log-analyzer-threat-detection
A Python-based log analyzer that detects suspicious activities and potential security threats

# Log Analyzer & Threat Detection Tool

## Overview
This project analyzes system log files to detect suspicious login activities such as brute-force attempts.

## Why this project?
Log analysis is a critical task in security operations centers (SOC).  
This tool demonstrates basic threat detection logic using real-world log patterns.

## Features
- Detects failed login attempts
- Identifies suspicious IP addresses
- Uses threshold-based detection
- Simple and readable Python logic

## Tools Used
- Python
- File handling
- Dictionaries for counting events

## What I Learned
- How security teams analyze logs
- Detecting brute-force behavior
- Writing clean and maintainable security scripts
